// This first block is the disk’s superblock where the first 32 bits pertain to the  
// inode count in little endian form. This disk has 4. The second 32 bits hold the 
// block count which is 200 (also in little endian form). The next important thing to 
// note here is the line at 00000450. The third set of 32 bits in that row denote the 
// location of the first group. In this case, it’s located at 0x800.
